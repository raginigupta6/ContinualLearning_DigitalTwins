# Twin-Adapt: Concept Drift Detection and Adaptation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the "Twin-Adapt" framework, which focuses on concept drift detection and adaptation using a dual adaptive windowing approach. The framework is designed to evaluate the performance of models in consecutive time series for cyber-physical systems equipped with IoT sensors.

The cyber-physical systems covered in this project include:
- Fume Hood
- Vacuum Pump
- Lithography Unit

## Objectives

- Detect and adapt to concept drift in IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems.
- Evaluate model performance under various drift conditions.
- Simulate concept drift by injecting noise distributions into training and testing data.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are proprietary and available upon request. Please contact the corresponding author for access to the datasets.
